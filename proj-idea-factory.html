            <p>I had always wanted to make-over my office space; Design Week 2019 was the catalyst that made it happen.</p>
            
            <p>The remodel started after realizing we were about show off our company to 100 new friends from the Design Week community. Much to my horror, I knew, I couldn't bring these folks, in good conscience, into my area. Then and there, the design wheels started spinning in my head on how I would reinvent my workspace.</p>
            
            <p>It started with a napkin sketch, indeed keeping with the theme of our event, and proceeded with consulting the creative minds of our company, to come up with an agreed upon and stunning design concept.</p>
            
            <p>Being an artist myself, I rolled up my sleeves, sat down at the computer, and got creative. Once I had a design nailed down, I handed off the specifics to our project management team. They handle all aspects of any job including pricing, purchasing materials, required scheduling production machines, and installation logistics. Next, the project moved on to our design services folks who made finished/producible art. From there, it went to our Prepress department who formatted files for our printers which are run by our experienced printer operators. To finish the process, our finishing team were delivered the pieces of the project at which time they finished bringing my idea to life. </p>
            
            <p>I can honestly say, I was thrilled to bring my new Design Week friends to see our new "Idea-factory space". And, it may be my imagination, but my coworkers seem to be spending more time loitering in my area.</p>
            
            <p>If you find yourself in a similar situation and you need someone to bring your creation to life, I can give you no bigger recommendation to the company I work for; they rejuvinated my area in impressive fashion, I know they can do the same for you.</p>
